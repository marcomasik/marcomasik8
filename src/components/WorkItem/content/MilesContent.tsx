                            Miles Mobility is one of Germany’s largest independent car-sharing companies. 
                            Notable for being one of the few not backed by a car manufacturer. Operating across many German cities, 
                            its unique pay per distance model sets it apart from competitors.
                            As the company scaled, the marketing team needed a new website that could handle dynamic campaigns, achieve top SEO scores, 
                            and reflect the bold, youthful identity of the brand.
